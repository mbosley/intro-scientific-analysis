# Introduction to Scientific Analysis
## Course Description

This course prepares students to engage with the field of political science by
introducing them to the basic logic and tools used by political scientists to
understand and explain the political world.  The course will teach students how
political scientists ask answerable questions; how we define key political
concepts; how we formulate hypotheses and theories about political dynamics; how
we measure the phenomena we want to study; how we think about and assess
relationships of cause-and-effect; and how we report our findings to the world.
We will consider these issues by examining how political scientists have
investigated major questions in domestic and international affairs, such as why
ethnic diversity sometimes leads to civil war, whether international
intervention can bring about democracy, and how we can determine which country
has the best healthcare policies.

## Land Acknowledgement

UBC’s Point Grey Campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded
territory of the Musqueam people. The land on which we are learning has
always been a place of learning for the Musqueam people, who for millennia
have passed on their culture, history, and traditions from one generation to the
next on this site.

## Class Meetings

Your attendance at lectures is mandatory. The course also includes a weekly
tutorial, starting in Week 2, led by your teaching assistant in which your
attendance and participation is required. See the section below on “Grading and
Assessed Coursework” for further details on the grading of tutorial attendance
and participation.

## Required Readings

1. Custom Coursepack or Library Online Course Reserve: There are two ways in
   which you can access the required readings for the course. You may purchase a
   custom coursepack at the UBC Bookstore. Alternatively, you can find the
   readings in electronic form on the Library Online Course Reserve system,
   which you can access from the POLI 110 Canvas site.
2. Readings Available Electronically: As listed below in the detailed syllabus,
   some required readings for the course are electronically available either on
   the Course Website (see section below on the Course Website), through the UBC
   Library Online Catalogue, or simply through a link on the web. It is your
   responsibility to download all readings from the appropriate location.

## Grading and Assessed Course Work

### A. Midterm (20%) and Final Examinations (25%)

There are two exams. The exams will test you on material in the lectures,
tutorials, and readings for the weeks that they cover (as indicated here):
1. Midterm Exam. This midterm will assess material covered in Topics 2 through
   6, as indicated on the syllabus, and will be worth 20% of your overall mark.
2. Final Exam (Date and Time to be Set by Registrar). The Final Exam will be
   worth 25% of your overall grade.  For those unable to take an exam in person,
   there will be an option to take the exam at the same time but remotely.
   Documentation will be required to take the exam remotely.
   
### B. Lecture attendance and participation via Top Hat (15%)
TODO: Revise to remove Top Hat

Lecture attendance will be taken via Top Hat. Also, in most lectures, you will
be asked to answer one or more questions using Top Hat. 15% of your mark for
POLI 110 will depend on a combination of your attendance and your participation
in lectures. Your mark does not depend on whether you get the answers right. The
questions are exercises to provoke discussion and learning. However, to get
credit for participation at a given lecture, you must be present at the lecture
or watching online in real time and input responses to all questions using your
own device (phone, tablet, or computer) during the designated time interval for
each question. Each student is permitted 2 unexcused missed lectures. (See below
for policy on missed class sessions.)

If you are sick or need to self-isolate, it is important that you stay home.
Complete a self-assessment for COVID-19 symptoms here:
https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en. You can still get full marks for attendance
and participation by watching the livestream of the lecture and using Top Hat to
indicate your attendance and to participate in activities. You do not need to
seek a concession or provide a reason for attending class online.

For some of the Top Hat exercises, you will be asked first to discuss the
question with 2-3 people sitting near you (or, if you’re at home, to give the
question some thought on your own) and only then to register your answer with
Top Hat.

Lecture attendance and participation will each be marked, separately, on the
following principle (with attendance and participation calculated after dropping
up to 2 unexcused absences):
- 100% attendance = A+ (90) for lecture attendance
- 100% Top Hat participation = A+ (90) for lecture participation
- Each lecture absence = loss of 4 points from lecture attendance grade
- Each lecture without Top Hat participation = loss of 4 points from lecture
  participation grade
- A lecture absence automatically counts as missed Top Hat participation for
  that lecture

### C. Weekly Tutorial Attendance and Participation, starting WEEK 2 (15%)

Attendance and active participation in the weekly tutorial led by your teaching
assistant is required and will be worth a total of 15% of your overall grade.
You will be allowed one unexcused absence from tutorial during the term. (See
policies on missed class sessions below.) Except for the two tutorial sections
designated as “Online,” all tutorials will be held in- person.  In general, you
must attend YOUR tutorial session to get attendance credit; this is the tutorial
session for which you are officially registered. You will be counted as absent
if you attend a different tutorial session instead of the one you are registered
in. (Exceptions for emergency situations are covered below under “Missed Class
Sessions.”)

Tutorials will address and expand upon the topic that was covered the previous
week in lecture. Prior to each tutorial, you must have carefully read all
required readings for the previous week’s topic.  Tutorials are
discussion-based. Your Tutorial Attendance and Participation mark will be based
not just on whether you show up to tutorial but also whether you actively
participate in discussions in a constructive manner. Your participation should
reflect solid preparation – having attended lectures, done the required
readings, thought about the material and done your best to understand it, and
made a serious effort on the homework assignment (if one was assigned for that
week). Note that constructive participation can include not only providing
thoughtful answers to questions posed by your TA but also asking questions about
material that you have struggled to understand. This means that, before coming
to tutorial, you should think carefully about what you do not understand about
the concepts and issues covered in lectures and readings and try to formulate
your questions as clearly as you can.

***NOTE: If a statutory holiday falls on the regular meeting day of your
tutorial section, you must still attend tutorial that week on a different day.
To receive credit for attending a tutorial session that is not your own, you
must fill in the “Alternative Tutorial Attendance Form” and have the TA of the
alternative session sign and submit it to your own TA. You can find this form
under “Modules” on the course Canvas site.***

Tutorial attendance will each be marked on the following principle (with
attendance calculated after dropping up to 1 unexcused tutorial absence):
- 100% attendance = A+ (90) for attendance grade
- Each tutorial absence = loss of 8 points from tutorial attendance grade
- A tutorial absence automatically also counts as no participation for that tutorial session

Tutorial participation will be marked based on both how regularly you
participate in tutorial discussions and on the quality of that participation. We
do not expect each student to make several comments in each session. However,
achieving a high participation mark will typically mean participating at least
once or twice in each session. The quality of comments or questions (do they
reflect solid preparation, thoughtful engagement with the material, etc.) is as
important as the quantity of participation.

If you are sick or need to self-isolate, it is important that you stay home. If
you miss your tutorial session for any reason, you should try to attend an
alternative session in the same week (assuming that it is safe and feasible for
you to do so). If you will be attending an alternative session, you should email
the TA for that alternative section to ask permission to attend their session.
You must also fill in the “Alternative Tutorial Attendance Form” (found under
“Modules” on the course Canvas site) and have the TA of the session you’re
attending sign the form; you then submit the form to your own TA to get credit
for attendance.

#### If your TA is feeling ill
If your TA is unwell, they will not come to class. Your TA will make every reasonable attempt to communicate plans for tutorial as soon as possible (by email, on Canvas, etc.). Your TA may run the tutorial online, and the tutorial classroom will still be available for you to sit in and attend an online session.
Tutorials begin in Week 2 of the semester.

### D. Homework Assignments (4 x 6.25% = 25%)
There will be 4 Homework assignments. All Homework assignments are due Monday at
9am, the week after they are distributed. They must be submitted electronically
to both turnitin.com and Canvas.

The Homework assignments are intended to help you work through the material
presented in lecture and in course readings by applying key concepts, arguments,
and methods to real-world political issues.

For each assignment, you will choose one topic discussed in one of the following
5 collections of articles about current social and political issues on The
Conversation website. The articles under each topic provide a wealth of
information about a major political or policy issue in the world today. You are
welcome to choose different topics for different homework assignments, or to use
the same topic repeatedly: it is entirely up to you. You must draw on the
material at any of the following 5 links:

## Missed Class Sessions, Late Assignments, and Missed Examinations
### General policies on absence and late assignments
#### Absence from Lecture or Tutorial
Each student is allowed 2 unexcused lecture absences and 1 unexcused tutorial
absence without any mark deduction; there is no need to provide a reason to your
TA or instructor for absences within this limit. However, missing additional
lectures or tutorials will result in a deduction from your lecture participation
or tutorial attendance/participation mark, unless you request and receive an
in-term concession from your TA.

#### Late Homework Assignments
Late assignments will incur penalties unless an in-term concession has been
requested and received from your TA in a timely manner. Each Homework assignment
is worth 5 points of your total course grade:
- The loss of half credit for assignments turned in within the first 24 hours
  after the time they are due
- No credit for assignments turned in more than 24 hours late

#### Missed examinations
If you miss an examination, you will result in a grade of zero unless an in-term
concession has been requested and received. As noted above, there will be
opportunities for those who are unable to take an exam in-person to take the
exam remotely.

### Accommodation
The University accommodates students with disabilities who have registered with
the Center for Accessibility. The University accommodates students whose
religious obligations conflict with attendance, submitting assignments, or
completing scheduled tests and examinations. Please let me know in advance,
preferably in the first week of class, if you expect to require accommodation on
any of these grounds. Students who plan to be absent for varsity athletics,
family obligations, or other similar commitments, cannot assume they will be
accommodated, and should discuss their commitments with me before the course
drop date.

### Academic concessions
An in-term concession is an exception to or variance in the timing or nature of
a specific course requirement, provided because of an unanticipated circumstance
that interferes with a student’s ability to accomplish academic coursework or
attend class. Students who need an in-term concession, such as additional time
for an assignment or being excused from attending class, must contact their TA
via email as soon as the problem arises. This usually means before the
assignment due date or the missed class. Requests for a concession made after an
assignment’s due date may not be considered. Please include with your request a
Student Self-Declaration form, found on the Arts Advising website. If you
require a second in-term concession, your TA may direct you to Arts Advising for
adjudication of your request.

Concessions are generally reserved for unforeseeable events that are outside a
student’s control. Having multiple papers due in the same week is not grounds
for a concession. When you know of such situations ahead of time, it is your
responsibility to organize your work for this course so that you can turn in the
assignment on time. This may mean getting an early start on a paper. In general,
a valid request for concession will fall into one of three categories:

1. Conflicting responsibilities: if a non-academic responsibility interferes
   with your ability to fulfill course requirements in a timely manner. This
   includes the need to care for a family member; religious observance,
   representing UBC, BC, or Canada in a competition or performance; military
   service; court proceedings). Normally, we expect that you will choose your
   courses in a way that makes it possible to fulfill your academic commitments
   and other responsibilities that you know that you have. Thus, concessions for
   conflicting responsibilities will usually be limited to situations in which
   the new responsibilities arose after you had enrolled in the course. You
   should, of course, also make sure that the responsibilities that you have to
   each of your courses do not conflict with one another.
2. Medical reasons: if an acute medical condition or the emergence/change in a
   chronic medical condition, including both physical and mental health,
   interferes with your ability to fulfill course responsibilities in a timely
   manner. Note that students who need to stay at home because of mild symptoms
   that might be COVID-related will generally be expected to attend class
   online. Medical reasons for not attending class online would include more
   severe symptoms that make it difficult to concentrate, focus on a computer
   screen, or do academic work. Remember also that, if you miss your tutorial,
   the first thing you should try to do is attend an alternative tutorial
   session in the same week (fill in the “Alternative Tutorial Attendance
   Form”), when it is safe and feasible to do so and with the permission of the
   TA leading the alternative section.
3. Compassionate reasons: relating to a traumatic event experienced by you, a
   family member, or a close friend.
   
Extensions will usually not be granted for work lost due to computer crashes or
the loss of a computer file. The reason for this is that there are simple and
free ways of regularly and automatically backing up your work. I recommend that
all students subscribe to a free, automatic online backup service. These
services will ensure that your files are backed up to a remote server at least
once a day, and often continuously or every time you hit “Save”. Thus, even if
your computer dies, there is no reason you should not be able to retrieve a
quite current copy of your work.

IMPORTANT: All accommodations or concessions must be recorded in writing via
email. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that there is an email
record of any accommodation or concession they have received. Thus, even if you
and your TA have had a face-to-face conversation about an extension, you must
send the TA an email confirming the concession. This simply ensures that we have
a record of any individualized arrangements that have been made.

Students should retain a copy of all submitted assignments (in case of loss) and
should also retain all their marked assignments in case they wish to apply for a
Review of Assigned Standings.

### Meeting with me

I am very happy to meet to discuss any issues or concerns that arise over the
course of the term. This includes further discussion of substantive topics in
the course, problems you may be having completing requirements, or concerns you
have about the way the course is being run. If you cannot make it to my office
hours, please see me after class or email me to make an appointment at another
time. For issues that can be dealt with electronically, email is usually the
fastest way to reach me, and I tend to respond quickly.  Read the university
calendar so that you are aware of no-penalty drop dates, requirements for
medical authorization (to defer an exam, for example) and other procedures that
may affect you:

## Cheating and Plagiarism
TODO: Add ChatGPT policy

Academic dishonesty in the form of cheating or plagiarism will not be tolerated.
The University considers plagiarism to be the most serious academic offence that
a student can commit. Plagiarism includes but is not limited to the presentation
or submission of the work of another person, without citation or credits, as the
student's own work. Whether intentional or accidental, instances of plagiarism
will have serious academic consequences.

Many students who believe they know what plagiarism is do not
actually have a clear understanding of where the line between proper and
improper use of sources lies. I thus strongly encourage you to read the UBC
library’s excellent online resources at
http://learningcommons.ubc.ca/resource-guides/avoiding-plagiarism/.

If you have any doubts about how and when to properly acknowledge another
person’s work, please discuss these with the course instructor.  Punishment for
cheating or plagiarism will include a grade of zero and other disciplinary
action. Please refer to the University policies on cheating and plagiarism for
examples of what constitutes academic misconduct and the extent of disciplinary
action that could be taken.
http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,959

### Turnitin.com
It is the official policy of the Department of Political Science that all
written course work be submitted to turnitin.com to check for possible signs of
plagiarism (unless there are exceptional reasons why an assignment should be
exempted).

All Homework assignments for this course must be uploaded to turnitin.com by the
due date. Assignments not submitted to turnitin.com will not be marked. Before
submitting, you must first visit www.turnitin.com to register for a username and
password that will allow you to use the system. We will distribute enrollment
details (section IDs and passwords) for each tutorial section shortly.

Please be assured that “originality” results from turnitin.com will never by
themselves be used as proof of plagiarism. Instructors merely use these results,
along with their own knowledge of writings in the field, to help identify
possible cases of plagiarism that they should look at more closely. No student
can ever be accused of plagiarism solely on the basis of turnitin.com
“originality” scores.



## Communication with Teaching Staff
For any questions or concerns about the course as a whole, please contact your
TA or the course instructor via e-mail or stop by the TA’s or my office hours.
Any questions about the material covered in lectures may be directed to the
course instructor or to your TA. Questions about the tutorial should be directed
to your TAs, whose email addresses are listed on the first page of this
syllabus. As discussed above, requests for an excused absence from lecture or
tutorial, or for an assignment extension, should be addressed to your TA.

Emails with course announcements, details on required readings and other
important information will often be sent to registered students via the Student
Services system. It is your responsibility to make sure that the email address
you have registered with UBC is valid and to check your email at this address
regularly so that you do not miss these announcements.

## Course Webpage and Emails
There is a course webpage for POLI 110 on UBC’s Canvas System. You can log in at
canvas.ubc.ca with your CWL username and password. I will use this page to post
important course documents (readings, syllabus, assignments, lecture slides
etc.) throughout the term.
